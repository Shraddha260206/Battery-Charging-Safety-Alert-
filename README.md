🔋 Battery Charging Safety Alert – Interaction Prototype

A user-centric interaction prototype designed to promote safe and healthy device charging habits through clear, state-based alerts and overheating warnings.

📌 Overview

Battery Charging Safety Alert helps users make better charging decisions by translating battery and temperature data into simple, actionable notifications. Along with charging alerts, the system also warns users when the device begins to overheat, helping protect battery health and device safety.

This project focuses on interaction logic and UX design, not hardware-level implementation.

⚙️ How It Works

The system monitors battery level and device temperature and responds using defined states:

🔋 Battery States

🔴 Below 20% → Charge reminder

🟢 20% – 80% → Safe charging zone

🔔 Above 80% → Unplug alert

🌡️ Temperature State

⚠️ Overheating detected → Safety warning to unplug or cool the device

All alerts are designed to be clear, timely, and non-intrusive.

🎨 Design & UX

Low-fidelity wireframes to visualize alerts and transitions

Simple feedback to reduce alert fatigue

📊 System States Summary
State	Description
🔴 Low Charging	Battery below 20%, charging recommended
🟢 Normal	Battery within safe usage range
🔔 High Charging	Battery above 80%, unplug suggested
❌ Bad Charging	Overcharging or unsafe charging detected
✅ Good Charging	Optimal charging conditions
🌡️ Overheating	Device temperature exceeds safe limit
