# 🔋 Battery Charging Safety Alert
### A UX Interaction Prototype for Smarter & Safer Charging

---

## 🌟 About the Project

**Battery Charging Safety Alert** is a **user-centric interaction prototype** designed to promote **safe, healthy, and battery-friendly charging habits**.

Instead of overwhelming users with technical battery data, the system converts **battery level** and **device temperature** into **clear, meaningful alerts** that help users make better charging decisions.

> ⚡ This project focuses on **UX interaction logic and design**, not hardware-level implementation.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Many users:
- Overcharge their devices regularly  
- Ignore early overheating signs  
- Lack awareness of optimal charging ranges  

This prototype addresses these issues through **state-based feedback** that is:
- Simple  
- Non-intrusive  
- Actionable  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

The system continuously monitors:
- 🔋 **Battery percentage**
- 🌡️ **Device temperature**

Based on these values, the system switches between **predefined states** and triggers alerts **only when necessary**.

No spam. No panic. Just smart nudges.

## 🔋 Battery Charging States

### 🔴 Low Battery (Below 20%)
- Charging reminder is shown  
- Prevents sudden shutdowns  

### 🟢 Safe Zone (20% – 80%)
- Optimal charging range  
- No alerts displayed  

### 🔔 High Battery (Above 80%)
- Suggests unplugging  
- Helps reduce battery degradation  

---

## 🌡️ Temperature Safety State

### ⚠️ Overheating Detected
- Immediate safety warning  
- Suggests unplugging or cooling the device  
- Charging safety is prioritized over completion
